# REGISTRATION NUMBERS WEB APP

## Introduction

In this registration numbers web app, you can enter a registration number plate and add it to the program (it will be added as soon as you click the 'add' button ). When you select a town from the listed towns and click on the 'show' button, all the registration number plates from the town you selected will be displayed.

All the registration number plates that are added to the program are saved on the database.

If you don't enter anything on the space provided for the registration number plate and click the add button, the program will not perform any task and the database will also not accept that.
